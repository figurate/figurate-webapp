Figurate
========

The general idea of Figurate is to create an extensible and open platform for building a knowledge base. Typically
organisations use multiple tools to manage documents, specifications, configurations, etc., which leads to a
confusing and disconnected approach to environment management.

Some key concepts/elements:

 * OSGi - plugin/extension support for adding data sources and outputs
 * Camel - routing of data into, out of, and around the platform
 * JCR - use a hierarchical repository to store data, documents and other environment artifacts

Some interesting things to explore:

 * How relevant is swarm behaviour? Do many simple plugins lead to emergent behaviour/characteristics?
